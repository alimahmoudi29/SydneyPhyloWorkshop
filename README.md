# Sydney Phylogenetics Workshop

This free 3-day workshop provides an introduction to phylogenetic analysis, including practical exercises based on the software MEGA and BEAST. It is suitable for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. Prior knowledge of basic phylogenetics is helpful but not essential. 

The workshop comprises a series of lectures and practical exercises. The first day covers interpreting phylogenetic trees, molecular data, sequence alignment, evolutionary models, and phylogenetic methods. The second day provides an introduction to Bayesian phylogenetic analysis and includes Bayesian statistics, priors, and molecular dating. The third day covers more advanced topics, including phylogenomics and demographic analysis. 

The workshop was last held at the University of Sydney in July 2017. It is run annually and the next workshop is scheduled for July 2018.
