# Sydney Phylogenetics Workshop

This free 2-day workshop provides an introduction to phylogenetic analysis, including practical exercises based on the software MEGA and BEAST2. It is suitable for research students, postdoctoral researchers, and academics. Prior knowledge of basic phylogenetics is helpful but not essential. 

The workshop comprises a series of lectures and practical exercises. The first day covers interpreting phylogenetic trees, molecular data, sequence alignment, evolutionary models, and phylogenetic methods. The second day provides an introduction to Bayesian phylogenetic analysis and includes Bayesian statistics, priors, and molecular dating.
