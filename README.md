# Sydney Phylogenetics Workshop

This free 2-day workshop provides an introduction to phylogenetic analysis, including practical exercises based on the software MEGA and BEAST2. It is suitable for research students, postdoctoral researchers, and academics. Prior knowledge of basic phylogenetics is helpful but not essential. 

The workshop comprises a series of lectures and practical exercises. The first day covers interpreting phylogenetic trees, molecular data, sequence alignment, evolutionary models, and phylogenetic methods. The second day provides an introduction to Bayesian phylogenetic analysis and includes Bayesian statistics, priors, and molecular dating.

Workshop materials were written by Simon Ho, with input from various contributors over the years (including Rob Lanfear, Sebastian Duchene, David Duchene, Mark de Bruyn, and Nate Lo).

The materials in this repository are from the most recent edition of the workshop, held in July 2018 at the University of Sydney. The next workshop will be held on 15â€“16 July 2019 at the University of Sydney.
