# [Sydney Phylogenetics Workshop](https://meep.sydney.edu.au/workshops/)

This free workshop provides an introduction to phylogenetic analysis, including practical exercises based on the software MEGA and BEAST2. It is suitable for research students, postdoctoral researchers, and academics. Prior knowledge of basic phylogenetics is helpful but not essential. 

The workshop comprises a series of lectures and practical exercises, usually held over two days. The first day covers interpreting phylogenetic trees, molecular data, sequence alignment, evolutionary models, and phylogenetic methods. The second day provides an introduction to Bayesian phylogenetic analysis and includes Bayesian statistics, priors, and molecular dating.

Workshop materials were written by Simon Ho, with input from various contributors over the years (including Rob Lanfear, Sebastian Duchene, David Duchene, Mark de Bruyn, Nate Lo, and members of the Molecular Ecology, Evolution, and Phylogenetics research group at the University of Sydney).

The materials in this repository are from the most recent workshop, which was held on 15â€“16 July 2019 at the University of Sydney. The workshop was led by Simon Ho and David Duchene. 

The [11th annual Sydney Phylogenetics Workshop](https://meep.sydney.edu.au/workshops/) will be held in December 2020.
